<p>About Me</p>
<p>I started working when I was 16. I was allowed to get a job so that I may have some spending money. My first job was a fast food Japanese food called Yoshinoya. In my first week on the job I was put in a race to be better since they hired two students and whoever performs better will get more hours. Lucky for me I grew up doing hard work so when it came time to do the hard labor I was ready, my competition not so much he quit after 2 weeks since the kitchen was fast paced and he wanted a relaxed job. I did this job until I graduated high school.</p>
<p> After graduation I went to work in a factory that will show me what long hours and back breaking work really was. Since I started in summer by september i wanted to quit but i had no way of doing so since i had no education and now i was living on my own, well i had a roommate we share the rent and food.</p> 
<p>It took 16 months for me to start my new life, a life full of opportunities and life choices that I never knew I could have. It was here where I learned how to be on time, do your job well, pay attention to details, follow and later on lead.</p>
